# Architecture

Define the technical structure. Components, data flow, API contracts, integration points, technology decisions. **Contracts first, implementation second.**

## When to Use

- Designing a new feature or system
- Defining API contracts between client and server
- Choosing data models and storage strategies
- Planning integration with external services or AI agents
- Making technology or pattern decisions
- Choosing orchestration patterns for multi-agent systems

## Core Principle: Start with the Right Complexity

Before introducing architecture, evaluate what level you actually need:

| Level | When | Example |
|-------|------|---------|
| **Direct call** | Single-step task, no coordination | Call an API, transform data |
| **Single service with tools** | One domain, some dynamic routing | Agent with multiple tools |
| **Multi-component orchestration** | Cross-domain, security boundaries, specialization | Multiple agents, BFF, adapters |

Use the lowest level that reliably meets requirements. Every abstraction layer adds coordination overhead, latency, and failure modes. Justify each one.

## Process

### 1. Understand Constraints

- **What exists** — current architecture, patterns, conventions
- **What's changing** — requirements from design phase
- **What's fixed** — tech stack, deployment, team conventions

### 2. Define Contracts First

TypeScript interfaces and API contracts before implementation. Contracts are the single source of truth.

**REST endpoints:**
```typescript
POST /api/agents/:agentId/tasks
Request: { type: 'workflow_run' }
Response: { data: { taskId: string, status: 'queued' } }
```

**SSE event streams:**
```typescript
// Event types with typed payloads
type SSEEvent =
  | { event: 'task.started', data: { taskId: string } }
  | { event: 'task.progress', data: { step: string, progress: number } }
  | { event: 'task.completed', data: { taskId: string, result: TaskResult } }
```

**Shared schemas (Zod):**
```typescript
// Single source of truth — used by both frontend and backend
const TaskSchema = z.object({
  id: z.string(),
  status: z.enum(['queued', 'running', 'completed', 'failed']),
  result: TaskResultSchema.optional(),
})
```

Shared Zod schemas in a common package ensure frontend and backend stay in sync. Changes propagate through TypeScript's type system.

### 3. Define Components

| Component | Type | Responsibility | New/Modified |
|-----------|------|----------------|--------------|
| WorkflowService | Service | Orchestrates runs | Modified |
| PodAdapter | Adapter | Translates agent API | New |

### 4. Trace Data Flow

For each vertical slice, trace how data moves through the system:

```
User action → Route → Service → Adapter → External system
                                                ↓
                                      SSE events → Client
```

For each flow, define:
- Request/response shapes (reference the contracts from step 2)
- Error cases and how they propagate
- Real-time updates (what events, when)

### 5. Identify Integration Points

Where does this connect to other systems?
- **External APIs** — endpoints, auth, rate limits, error responses
- **Databases** — schema changes, migrations, indexes
- **Event systems** — SSE events published/consumed, reconnection behavior
- **Shared types** — cross-package contracts (Zod schemas, TypeScript types)

### 6. Record Decisions

Every non-obvious architectural choice gets an ADR (Architecture Decision Record):

| Decision | Alternatives Considered | Rationale |
|----------|------------------------|-----------|
| Adapter pattern for agent integration | Direct API calls | Decouples agent from platform; agents can be swapped |
| SSE for real-time events | WebSocket | Unidirectional sufficient; simpler reconnection; HTTP/2 multiplexing |

Capture the **why**, not just the **what**. Future developers need to understand context, not just the outcome.

## Agent Orchestration Patterns

When designing AI agent systems, choose the orchestration pattern that fits:

| Pattern | How It Works | Best For | Watch For |
|---------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| **Sequential** | Pipeline — each agent processes previous output | Step-by-step refinement with clear dependencies | Early failures propagate; no parallelism |
| **Concurrent** | Fan-out/fan-in — agents work in parallel | Independent analysis from multiple perspectives | Needs conflict resolution for contradictions |
| **Handoff** | Dynamic delegation — one active agent at a time | Right specialist emerges during processing | Infinite handoff loops |
| **Orchestrator-Worker** | Central coordinator delegates to specialists | Cross-domain tasks with clear subtask decomposition | Single point of failure in orchestrator |
| **Group Chat** | Agents contribute to shared conversation thread | Consensus-building, maker-checker validation | Conversation loops; hard to control with many agents |

**Default to single agent with tools.** Only introduce multi-agent orchestration when you can demonstrate a single agent can't reliably handle the task due to prompt complexity, tool overload, or security requirements.

## Patterns to Prefer

- **Adapter pattern** for external integrations — isolate external API specifics behind a consistent interface. Agents, payment providers, and third-party services all get adapters.
- **Service layer** for business logic — thin routes that validate and delegate. Logic lives in services, not handlers.
- **Shared Zod schemas** for cross-boundary contracts — single source of truth for data shapes, validated at system boundaries.
- **SSE for real-time** — not WebSocket unless bidirectional is required. SSE has automatic reconnection, uses standard HTTP, and multiplexes over HTTP/2.
- **BFF (Backend-for-Frontend)** when the frontend needs a different data shape than the backend provides — translate, aggregate, and protect.

## SSE Design Considerations

SSE is the primary real-time pattern for AI agent UIs. Key decisions:

- **Event types** — use named events (`event: task.progress`) with typed JSON payloads
- **Reconnection** — browsers auto-reconnect. Set `retry:` field for custom intervals. Send `id:` on events so clients can resume via `Last-Event-ID` header.
- **Heartbeat** — send a comment (`: heartbeat`) every ~15s to keep connections alive and detect drops
- **Error propagation** — send error events in-stream rather than closing the connection for recoverable errors
- **HTTP/2** — eliminates the 6-connection-per-domain limit of HTTP/1.1

## Guidelines

- **Contract first.** Define interfaces and schemas before implementing anything. Frontend and backend can build in parallel against the contract.
- **Match existing patterns.** Don't introduce new patterns without justification. Consistency reduces cognitive load.
- **Minimum viable architecture.** Simplest thing that works. Every abstraction must justify its existence. YAGNI ruthlessly — don't design for hypothetical future requirements.
- **Flag unknowns.** Ask rather than guess. Uncertainty is cheaper to resolve through conversation than through code.
- **Design for failure.** Every API call can fail. Every connection can drop. Every external service can be slow. Define error paths explicitly, not as afterthoughts.
- **Record why.** Decisions without rationale are impossible to evaluate later. ADR format: context → decision → consequences.
