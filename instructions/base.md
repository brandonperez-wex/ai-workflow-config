## Security

- Never commit secrets, API keys, or credentials
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Validate all user input
- Follow OWASP guidelines for web applications

## Testing

- Write tests before or alongside code (TDD/eval-driven)
- Aim for meaningful coverage, not 100% coverage
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Keep tests fast and independent

## Documentation

- Document the "why", not just the "what"
